I loved this challenge a lot so I will write this first. Our evidence is a VMDK file, normally you will use VMware to open it but because I don't have that one and I don't want to install 
too so I used 7-zip to open it:

With the question 1, just find the hash inside **/etc/shaodw** and crack it by using **john**:

Open .bash_history, we will see that he did many things including install something named Wire:

Find it on Google, you will find its informaion, it's one of the safe messaging app. Next, we need to find their usernames, the easiest way is that you run Wire on their machine:

If you don't want to open VMware, inside Wire configurations you can check **/home/imsadboi/.config/Wire/IndexedDB/https_app.wire.com_0.indexeddb.leveldb/000003.log**. During their conversation, they traded file together:

To know that whether they downloaded it or not, we can check easily in Firefox history, which is stored in **places.sqlite**:

After they had downloaded the file, I'm sure that the file is still be there, we found it on system. Unzip and it will extract .git folder, from that we used `git log`:

For the last two challenges, I used ArsenalImageMounter and choose Recovery Files, you can recover the original credentials.txt:

That's all my progress. Thank you very much for reading my blog. See you in the next post. Bye!!! ðŸ«€ðŸ«€ðŸ«€
